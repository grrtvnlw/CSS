                    <h1>Introducing Apex Ping</h1>
                    <p>I'd like to introduce <a href="https://apex.sh/ping/" target="_blank">Apex Ping</a>! A minimalistic, but powerful uptime & 
                        performance monitoring service for websites and APIs.  In this post I'll cover 
                        features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it first, and a few things I learned
                        in the process. In future posts I'll be detailing the implementation for anyone 
                        who is curious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I soft-launched Ping about a month ago, built almost 100% on AWS Lambda,
                        with 500 users it has already detected over a million errors, and performed
                        over 25 million checks. Big thanks to the early adopters who have checked it 
                        out!
                    </p>

                    <h2>The product</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've seen first-hand how embarassing it can be when customers find out 
                        your product is having issues before you do, naturally this can translate to
                        customers bailing on your product. Ensuring you site, app, or API is stable
                        and performant is critical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apex Ping helps by making sure your team is notified when there's a 
                        performance regression, or when your end-point is down or unresponsive.
                        Often people rely on "it works for me", but Apex Ping's reporting can help
                        uncover the full story.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Powerful monitoring</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike some other uptime monitoring services, which only support HEAD 
                        requests, Apex Ping support header fields and bodies as well. This allows
                        you to test APIs, caching behaviour, and serving time, as well as the typical
                        connection latency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The checks listing displays the uptime, mean response, Apdex score, and
                        Apdex score throughout the day, week, or month. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex" target="_blank">Apdex</a> score
                        generalizes the user experience, summarizing response time satisfaction and 
                        error responses.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Global checks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Requests or "checks" are performed from a number of selectable PoPs (Point 
                        of Presence), giving you a glance at the customer experience all over the 
                        world. Hovering a PoP provides you with the breakdown, and coloring
                        indicates their relative health so you can instantly see if a region's
                        availability or performance is degraded.

                    <h3>Latency distribution</h3>
                    <p>
                        When latency is a reflection of the user-experience, it's important not to
                        ignore the outliers. The Latency view provides yoiu with an intuitive look at
                        distribution throughout the selected time period, where the intensity of the 
                        heatmap represents the number of check's within the given duration.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Errors & Apdex</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex" target="_blank">Apdex</a> (Application Performance Index) score quantifies the user-experience
                        based on a configured target latency. It effectively lets you know
                        how far you are from hitting your mark, you should strive for a perfect 1.0!
                    </p>

                    <h2>IAM Policies</h2>
                    <p>
                        AWS uses IAM policies to permit access to various operations against
                        resources, such as allowing read-write access to DynamoDB.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Up now allows you to specify additional policy statements for the Lambda
                        function's role as shown in the following snippet. Re-deploy and your
                        permissions are applied!
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>                     
    { 
      "name": "myapp",
      "lambda": {
        "memory": 1024,
        "policy": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Action": [
              "dynamodb:Get*",
              "dynamodb:List*",
              "dynamodb:PutItem",
              "dynamodb:DeleteItem"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                    <blockquote>
                    Note that if you previously manually altered the function policy in the AWS 
                    console, these permissions should be moved to the <code>up.json</code>.
                    </blockquote>
                    <h2>Static Files for Dynamic Applications</h2>
                    <p>
                        Previously an Up project was either strictly static, or dynamic--now you can 
                        utilize static file serving for dynamic apps, Up will check if the file exists
                        before passing control to your application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pass the <code>dir</code> of your static files, with an optional prefix used on the client-side 
                        for requesting. In the following example <code>/static/css/style.css</code> would resolve to
                        <code>./public/css/style.css</code>.
                    </p>
